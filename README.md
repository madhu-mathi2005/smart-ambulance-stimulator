Project Description:
Developed a Smart Ambulance Traffic Priority System using Arduino UNO to provide automatic traffic signal clearance for emergency vehicles. The system detects ambulance presence using IR sensors and overrides normal traffic signals to ensure faster emergency response and reduced congestion.

Key Features:
1.Real-time ambulance detection using IR sensors
2.Automatic traffic signal override mechanism
3.Wireless communication using RF module
4.Embedded control logic implementation
5.Prototype-based traffic signal simulation

Technologies & Components Used:
-Arduino UNO
-IR Sensors
-RF Transmitter & Receiver Module
-Servo Motor
-LEDs (Traffic Signal Simulation)
-Embedded C (Arduino IDE)

System Working:
The system continuously monitors vehicle presence using IR sensors. When an ambulance is detected, a signal is transmitted via RF communication to the traffic control unit. The Arduino microcontroller processes the signal and overrides the regular traffic sequence, giving green signal priority to the ambulance path. After the ambulance passes, the system restores normal traffic operation.

Applications:
-Smart City Traffic Management
-Emergency Vehicle Priority Systems
-IoT-Based Urban Infrastructure
-Intelligent Transportation Systems

Project Highlights:
1.Designed sensor-based emergency detection mechanism
2.Implemented wireless signal communication
3.Developed automated signal switching logic
4.Demonstrated reduced traffic delay in emergency scenarios

Future Enhancements:
1.GPS-based ambulance tracking integration
2.GSM/Wi-Fi module for real-time monitoring
3.AI-based traffic density analysis
4.Integration with real-world smart traffic systems
